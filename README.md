# Rick and Morty Block Plugin for WordPress

This WordPress plugin demonstrates how to create a custom block using the Gutenberg block editor, which interacts with the **Rick and Morty API** to display characters from the popular TV show. The plugin includes a "Load More" button that fetches and displays additional character data from the API with the use of AJAX requests. This is a simple example to showcase how to integrate external APIs into WordPress custom blocks, enhancing functionality and user experience.
